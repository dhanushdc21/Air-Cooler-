## Introduction

Extreme temperatures during summer months have become a pressing issue, leading to increased electricity bills and the need for cost-effective cooling solutions. Our project aims to address these challenges by developing an air cooler that cools the air through the process of water evaporation. This solution not only reduces electricity consumption but also offers a versatile cooling option for both indoor and outdoor spaces.

## Features

- **Evaporative Cooling**: Utilizes the first law of thermodynamics to cool the air through water evaporation.
- **Structure**: Main components of the cooler are made from durable steel and high density thermocol.
- **Atomizer Control**: Adjustable atomizer ensures efficient water droplet size for optimal evaporation.
- **Electrical and Electronic Components**: Incorporates essential electrical components for efficient operation.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Fabrication Challenges

Initially, we faced difficulties in fabricating the entire structure using steel due to its complexity and rigidity. To overcome this, we utilized PVC sheets that can be easily bent by applying heat, allowing us to create the desired shapes and structures more efficiently.

### Atomizer Optimization

Achieving the correct diameter of water droplets for efficient evaporation was another challenge. Through trial and error, we were able to optimize the atomizer settings to produce water droplets that evaporate most effectively in our current setup.

## Technologies Used

Our project primarily relies on the principle of water evaporation and the first law of thermodynamics. While we did not incorporate many new technologies, we utilized the following components:

- **Steel**: For the main structural components.
- **High Density Thermocol**: For structural parts.
- **Electrical and Electronic Components**: For controlling and powering the cooler.
- **Atomizer**: For spraying water in optimized droplet sizes.
